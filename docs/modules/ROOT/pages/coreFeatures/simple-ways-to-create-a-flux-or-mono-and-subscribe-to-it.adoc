= Simple Ways to Create a Flux or Mono and Subscribe to It

The easiest way to get started with `Flux` and `Mono` is to use one of the numerous
factory methods found in their respective classes.

For instance, to create a sequence of `String`, you can either enumerate them or put them
in a collection and create the Flux from it, as follows:

[source,java]
[%unbreakable]
----
Flux<String> seq1 = Flux.just("foo", "bar", "foobar");

List<String> iterable = Arrays.asList("foo", "bar", "foobar");
Flux<String> seq2 = Flux.fromIterable(iterable);
----

Other examples of factory methods include the following:

[source,java]
[%unbreakable]
----
Mono<String> noData = Mono.empty(); <1>

Mono<String> data = Mono.just("foo");

Flux<Integer> numbersFromFiveToSeven = Flux.range(5, 3); <2>
----
<1> Notice the factory method honors the generic type even though it has no value.
<2> The first parameter is the start of the range, while the second parameter is the
number of items to produce.

When it comes to subscribing, `Flux` and `Mono` make use of Java 8 lambdas. You
have a wide choice of `.subscribe()` variants that take lambdas for different
combinations of callbacks, as shown in the following method signatures:

[[subscribeMethods]]
.Lambda-based subscribe variants for `Flux`
[source,java]
[%unbreakable]
----
subscribe(); <1>

subscribe(Consumer<? super T> consumer); <2>

subscribe(Consumer<? super T> consumer,
          Consumer<? super Throwable> errorConsumer); <3>

subscribe(Consumer<? super T> consumer,
          Consumer<? super Throwable> errorConsumer,
          Runnable completeConsumer); <4>

subscribe(Consumer<? super T> consumer,
          Consumer<? super Throwable> errorConsumer,
          Runnable completeConsumer,
          Consumer<? super Subscription> subscriptionConsumer); <5>
----
<1> Subscribe and trigger the sequence.
<2> Do something with each produced value.
<3> Deal with values but also react to an error.
<4> Deal with values and errors but also run some code when the sequence successfully
completes.
<5> Deal with values and errors and successful completion but also do something with the
`Subscription` produced by this `subscribe` call.

TIP: These variants return a reference to the subscription that you can use to cancel the
subscription when no more data is needed. Upon cancellation, the source should stop
producing values and clean up any resources it created. This cancel-and-clean-up behavior
is represented in Reactor by the general-purpose `Disposable` interface.
